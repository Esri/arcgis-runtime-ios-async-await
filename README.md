ArcGIS Runtime SDK for iOS async/await wrappers
==========================

This repository provides async wrappers for [ArcGIS Runtime SDK for iOS](https://developers.arcgis.com/ios/) asynchronous methods, for use with the async/await capabilities introduced in Swift 5.5.

Xcode will automatically generate async wrappers for most asynchronous methods, but if that method returns a value, then it must be wrapped explicitly with an async wrapper. For the ArcGIS Runtime SDK for iOS, this generally means that the loadable pattern is automatically wrapped, but most asynchronous methods in the Runtime SDK return an `AGSCancelable`, and so require custom wrapper methods to be defined.

## Features

* A comprehensive set of `async` wrappers for the asynchronous methods provided in the 100.12 release of the ArcGIS Runtime SDK for iOS.
* Helper actors to support these wrappers.
* A demo app showing async/await patterns in use with the ArcGIS Runtime SDK for iOS.

If you find any methods that are missing an async wrapper, please open an issue or, better yet, submit a PR adding the method.

## Requirements

* [ArcGIS Runtime SDK for iOS](https://developers.arcgis.com/ios/) 100.12.0 (or newer)
* Xcode 13.0 (or newer)
* iOS 15 (or newer)

## Known Issues
* Canceling an AGSJob requires manually wrapping the job in a cancelable task and calling `AGSJob.progress.cancel()`.

## Instructions

Add an `import ArcGISAsyncAwait` statement to your Swift source files. To include the source for `ArcGISAsyncAwait`, either use Swift Package Manager, or include the source files into your project.

### Swift Package Manager

 1. Open your project in Xcode.
 2. Go to **File** > **Add Packagesâ€¦**.
 3. Enter `https://github.com/Esri/arcgis-runtime-ios-async-await` as the Package URL.
 4. Set the `Dependency Rule` to **Branch** and reference the `main` branch. Click **Add Package**.
 
 Note: The ArcGIS Runtime Async Await Swift Package adds the ArcGIS Runtime SDK package as a dependency.

 New to Swift Package Manager? Visit [swift.org/package-manager/](https://swift.org/package-manager/).

### Manual

 1. Clone or download this repo.
 2. Drag and drop the `AsyncWrappers.swift` and `AsyncWrapperActors.swift` files into your project through the Xcode Project Navigator pane.
